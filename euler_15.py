# Problem Number 15
# Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, 
#     there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
# How many such routes are there through a 20Ã—20 grid?


#  Use a Pascals triangle to find the Binomial Coefficient 
#      that goes with the lattice square combination maximum
